# King Albert

This is an implementation of the card patience game [King Albert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Albert_(card_game)),
for the terminal.

I wrote this mainly as an exercise in learning OCaml.

To play:
1. Set up an OCaml development environment;
2. `cd` into the project root;
3. `dune exec ka`.
